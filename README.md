# BlockSocInductions
This is my project for the Blocksoc Inductions .

The task was ->
ZestMoney has designed its systems such that you have to be a registered user to use their portal to
take part/complete any transaction.
Design a smart contract implementing the registration of a new user with a username, a password, and a private user key.
The user would require all of these credentials to have the ability to transact any form of crypto.

P.S It's my first time properly using solidity.
